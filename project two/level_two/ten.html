    <h2>I Like For You To Be Still</h2><h4>Poem by Pablo Neruda</h4>
<p> I like for you to be still
It is as though you are absent
<b>And you hear me from far away</b>
And my voice does not touch you
It seems as though your eyes had flown away
And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth
As all things are filled with my soul
You emerge from the things
Filled with my soul
    <b>You are like my soul</b>
A butterfly of dream
And you are like the word: Melancholy</p></div>

<p>I like for you to be still
And you seem far away
It sounds as though you are lamenting
A butterfly cooing like a dove
<b>And you hear me from far away</b>
And my voice does not reach you
Let me come to be still in your silence
And let me talk to you with your silence
That is bright as a lamp
Simple, as a ring
<b>You are like the night</b>
With its stillness and constellations
Your silence is that of a star
As remote and candid</p></div>

<div id="container"><p>I like for you to be still
It is as though <b>you are absent
Distant and full of sorrow</b>
So you would’ve died
One word then, One smile is enough
And <b>I’m happy</b>;
Happy that it’s not true</p></div>
