<p> I Like For You To Be Still - Poem by Pablo Neruda</p>

<p>i like for you to be <br>still<br>
it is as though you are absent
And you hear me from far away
And my voice does not touch you
it seems as though your eyes had flown away
And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth
As all things are filled with my <br>soul<br>
You emerge from the things
Filled with my <br>soul<br>
You are like my <br>soul<br>
A butterfly of dream
And you are like the word: Melancholy

i like for you to be <br>still<br>
And you seem far away
it sounds as though you are lamenting
A butterfly cooing like a dove
And you hear me from far away
And my voice does not reach you
Let me come to be still in your <br>silence<br>
And let me talk to you with your <br>silence<br>
That is bright as a lamp
Simple, as a ring
You are like the night
With its stillness and constellations
Your silence is that of a star
As remote and candid

i like for you to be <br>still<br>
it is as though you are absent
Distant and full of sorrow
So you would've died
One word then, One smile is enough
And i'm happy;
Happy that it's not true
