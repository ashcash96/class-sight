I Like For You To Be Still

i like for you to be still
it is as though you are                                     absent
And you hear me from far away
And     my   voice   does   not     touch   
                                            you
                                        
                                      
                                      
                                      
it          as          your          flown
    seems       though          eyes            away
    
And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth

As all things are filled with my soul
You emerge from the things
                                        Filled with my soul
                                        You are like my soul
                                                                A butterfly of dream
                                                                                        And you are like the word: 
                                                                                        Melancholy

i like for you to be
still
And

you


seem 



far 





away








it sounds as though you are lamenting
    A butterfly cooing like a dove                                                                      And you hear me from far away


And my voice does not reach you

                                                Let me come to be still in your silence
                                                And let me talk to you with your silence
                                                        That is bright as a lamp
                                                            Simple, as a ring
                                                            You are like the
                                                                   night


                                            With     its    stillness   and     constellations
                                                Your     silence    is  that     of      a     
                                                                        star
                                                 As       remote      and         candid
                                                 

i like for you to be 
still

it is as though you are absent

Distant and full of sorrow

                            So you would've died
                            One     word    then, 
                            One     smile   is enough
                            
                            
                            
And i'm happy;



Happy that it's not true
