<p>I like for you to be still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as though you are absent
<br>And you hear me from far away
<br><br>And my voice does not touch you
<br>It seems as though your eyes had flown away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth
<br>As all things are filled with my soul
You emerge from the things
<br>Filled with my soul
<br>You are like my soul
<br>A butterfly of dream
<br>And you are like the word:<br><br><br> Melancholy</p>
      
<p>I like for you to be still<br>
And you seem far away<br>
It sounds as though you are lamenting<br>
A butterfly cooing like a dove<br>
And you hear me from far &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away<br>
And my voice does not reach you<br>
Let me come to be still in your silence<br>
And let me talk to you with your silence<br>
That is bright as a lamp<br>
Simple, as a ring<br>
You are like the night<br>
With its stillness and constellations<br>
Your silence is that of a star<br>
As remote and candid</p>
      

<p>I like for you to be still<br>
It is as though you are absent<br>
Distant and full of sorrow<br>
So you would've died<br>
One word then, One smile is enough<br>
And I'm happy;
Happy that it's not true
      </p>
