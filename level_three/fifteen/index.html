<div class=title><strong>I Like For You To Be Still </strong>
                    <br>by Paublo Neruda</div>
<div class=one>I like for you to be still<br>
It is as though you are absent<br>
And you hear me from far away<br>
And my voice does not touch you<br>
It seems as though your eyes had flown away<br>
And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth<br>
As all things are filled with my soul<br>
You emerge from the things<br>
Filled with my soul<br>
You are like my soul<br>
A butterfly of dream<br>
    And you are like the word:<br> <a href="#two">Melancholy</a></div>

    <div class=two>I like for you to be <a name="two">still</a><br>
And you seem far away<br>
It sounds as though you are lamenting<br>
A butterfly cooing like a dove<br>
And you hear me from far away<br>
And my voice does not reach you<br>
Let me come to be still in your silence<br>
And let me talk to you with your silence<br>
That is bright as a lamp<br>
Simple, as a ring<br>
You are like the night<br>
With its stillness and constellations<br>
        Your silence is that of a <a href="#three">star</a><br>
    As remote and candid</div>

                <div class=three><a name="three">I</a> like for you to be still<br>
It is as though you are absent<br>
Distant and full of sorrow<br>
So you would've died<br>
One word then, One smile is enough<br>
And I'm happy;<br>
    Happy that it's not true</div>
            </body>
