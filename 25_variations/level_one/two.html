      <p>
i like for you to be still
<br><br>
<br>i like for you to be still
<br>it is as though you are absent
<br>And you hear me from far away
<br>And my voice does not touch you
<br>it seems as though your eyes 
<br>had flown away
<br>And it seems that
<br>a kiss had sealed your mouth
<br>As all things are filled with my
<br>soul  You emerge from the things
<br>Filled with my soul
<br>You are like my soul
<br>A butterfly of dream
<br>And you are like the word:
<br>Melancholy
<br>
<br>i like for you to be still
<br>And you seem far away
<br>it sounds as though you are 
<br>lamenting A butterfly cooing like 
<br>a dove And you hear me from far away
<br>And my voice does not reach you
<br>Let me come to be still in your silence
<br>And let me talk to you with your silence
<br>That is bright as a lamp
<br>Simple, as a ring
<br>You are like the night
<br>With its stillness and 
<br>constellations Your silence 
<br>is that of a star As remote and 
<br>candid
<br>
<br>i like for you to be still
<br>it is as though you are absent
<br>Distant and full of sorrow
<br>So you would've died
<br>One word then, One smile 
<br>is enough
<br>And i'm happy;
<br>Happy that it's not
<br>true
<br>
