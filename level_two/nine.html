              <h1> I Like For You To Be Still</h1><h2>Poem by Pablo Neruda </h2><br><br>
              <h3> I like for you to be still</h3>
<h4>It is as though you are absent<br>
And you hear me from far away<br>
And my voice does not touch you<br>
It seems as though your eyes had flown away<br>
And it seems that a <i>kiss</i> had sealed your mouth<br>
As all things are filled with my <i>soul</i><br>
You emerge from the things<br>
Filled with my <i>soul</i><br>
You are like my <i>soul</i><br>
A butterfly of dream<br>
And you are like the word: <em>Melancholy</em></h4>

<h3>I like for you to be still</h3>
<h4>And you seem far away
It sounds as though you are <i>lamenting</i><br>
A butterfly cooing like a dove<br>
And you hear me from far away<br>
And my voice does not reach you<br>
Let me come to be still in your <i>silence</i><br>
And let me talk to you with your <i>silence</i><br>
That is bright as a lamp<br>
Simple, as a ring<br>
You are like the night<br>
With its stillness and constellations<br>
Your <i>silence</i> is that of a star<br>
As remote and candid</h4>

<h3>I like for you to be still</h3>
<h4>It is as though you are absent<br>
<i>Distant</i> and full of <i>sorrow</i><br>
So you would’ve died<br>
One word then, One smile is enough<br>
And I’m <i>happy</i>;<br>
Happy that it’s not true</h4>
