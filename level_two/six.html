      <h1> I Like For You To Be Still</h1>
          I like for you to be <em>still</em>
          <br>It is as though you are absent
          <br>
          <a href="#far">And you hear me from...</a>
          <br>And my voice does not touch <p align="right">you</p>
          It seems as though your <em>eyes had flown away</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          And it seems that a kiss had <strike><strong>sealed your mouth</strong></strike>
          <br>As all things are filled with my soul<br>
          You emerge from the things<br>
          Filled with my soul<br>
          You are like my soul<br>
          A butterfly of dream<br>
          And you are like the word: <h4>Melancholy</h4>

          I like for you to be <em>still</em>
              
          And you seem far away
          <br>
          It sounds as though you are lamenting
          A butterfly cooing like a <em>dove</em>
          <br>
          <a href="#far">And you hear me from...</a>
          <br>
          And my voice does not reach you
          <br>
          <br>
          <a href="#silence">Let me come to be still in your...</a><br>
          <a href="#silence">And let me talk to you with your...
          </a><br><br><br>
          That is bright as a 
          <br><br>lamp<br><br>
          Simple, as a ring<br>
          You are like the night<br>
          With its stillness and constellations<br>
          Your silence is that of a star<br>
          As remote and candid<br>

          I like for you to be still<br>
          It is as though you are absent<br>
          Distant and full of sorrow<br>
          So you would've died<br>
          One word then, One smile is enough<br>
          And I'm happy;<br><br><br><br>
          Happy that it's not true
          <br><br><br><br>
            <p id="far">far away</p>  
          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p id="silence">silence</p>
