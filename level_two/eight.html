       <h1> I Like For You To Be Still</h1>
              I like for you to be still
              <ol>
                  <li>it is as though you were absent,</li>
                  <li>and you hear me from far away </li><li>and my voice does not touch you.</li></ol>
              <p>It seems as though your <b>eyes</b> had flown away
                  and it seems that a kiss had sealed your <strong>mouth</strong>.</p>

              <h4>As all things are filled with <em>my soul</em>
you emerge from the things, filled with <em>my soul</em>.
You are like <em>my soul</em>, a butterfly of dream,
                  and you are like the word <strong>MELANCHOLY</strong>.</h4>

              I like for you to be still, <br><ul><li>and you seem far away.</li>
              <li>It sounds as though you were lamenting,</li><li>a butterfly cooing like a dove.</li><li>
              And you hear me from far away,</li><li>and my voice does not reach you:</li></ul>
<h4>Let me come to be still in your silence.<br>
And let me talk to you with your silence<br>
that is bright as a lamp, simple as a ring.<br>
You are like the night, with its stillness and constellations.<br>
    Your silence is that of a star, as remote and candid.</h4>
<br>
I like for you to be still: <br><br>
              it is as though you were <strong>absent,</strong>
              distant and full of sorrow as though you had <strong>died.</strong>
<br><br><br><br>One word then, one smile, is enough.
And I am happy, happy that it's not true.
